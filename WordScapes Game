Simulator to WordScapes on Play Store
#●       In this project we will create the console-based simulator of the wordscapes games, where the user is given some letters and the user has to guess the words from those letters.
'''
● This game is designed for only 5 levels.

● At each level the user will be given some letters and the user has to guess 3 words to move to the next level.

● If the user guesses the wrong word at any chance, the user will lose one live point and will be asked to give another word.

● The user will get 5 lives which means the user can make 5 wrong guesses.

● After 5 wrong guesses the game will automatically get over and the user will get the final score.

● But if the user makes correct 3 guesses, they will move to the next level.

● At the end of each level the user will be asked if the user wants to continue or not.

● If the user selects yes, the game will continue but if the user selects no then the game will stop at that level and the final score will be displayed.
